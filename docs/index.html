  Yancy is an API spam detector powered by magic.

<p>
  You can register for an API key by following @kameronkales on Twitter.
  <br>
  <br>

  I have not yet set up a sign up flow.
  <br>
  <br>

  The free tier can use up to 50 requests a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  I set this limit so I don't wake up with a $300 AWS bill.
  If you would like to use the service more please let me know.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once you have an API key using the service is very easy.
  <br>
  <br>
  You send 1 POST request to https://api.yancy.app/spam with the following in the body:
  <br>
  <br>
  {"api_key": "insert your api key here", "spam": "insert your content here"}
  <br>
  <br>
  You will receive a 200 Response if nothing breaks matching the format below:
  <br>
  <br>
    {
    "response": 200,
    "results": "False"
    }
    <br>
    <br>
    No links are allowed and most sexual comments are flagged as spam.
    <br>
    <br>
    The current accuracy score in my tests is 91%-ish.
    <br>
    <br>
    The model retrains nighly.
